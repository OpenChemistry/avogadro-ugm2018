Roundtable Discussion
=====

Initial notes for roundtable Discussion

Documentation Needs:
* Help wanted - interested in contributing, where do I start?
  - Easy on-boarding process
  - Docs on finding "if I want to change XYZ, where is that code"
* Plugin modules
  - Installing virtual environments and required modules
    - Do we just need examples or also docs
  - Compiling and downloading static binaries for Windows, Linux, Mac
* Documented JSON API for generators, workflows, etc.
* Using JSON-RPC for interprocess communication
  - Need for an "edit and send back" protocol?
* Unified roadmap / ideas (e.g., project management for 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, etc.)
* Where to keep this stuff?

Plugin Ecosystem:
* Guides and examples for plugins of different types
* How to handle approval?
* Website directory needs:
  - Register your plugin's GitHub repo
  - Search for plugin
  - Connect to reviews / issues / stars on the GitHub repo
